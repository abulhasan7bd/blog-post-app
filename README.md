React Loading Skeleton ⚙️:
I used the react-loading-skeleton package in the WishList section.
When the data is loading, a skeleton loader is shown to improve the user experience.
If there's an error while fetching data, an appropriate error message is displayed instead.

Benefits:
Improves UX by showing a visual loading state
Prevents layout shift during data fetching
Easy to implement and customize
- React Photo View
